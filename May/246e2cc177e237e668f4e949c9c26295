Cape Town - Former President Jacob Zuma is expected back in the Pietermaritzburg High Court today, although it is unclear if the case will proceed as the former head of state parted ways with his legal team last month with his new attorneys not known yet.As he is expected back in the dock on Monday, Zuma and his allies have remained mum on the former president’s next step despite him and his legal team of advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, Eric Mabuza SC, advocate Thabani Masuku SC, Rudolph Baloyi and advocate Mpilo Sikhakhane having parted ways.But the National Prosecuting Authority in KwaZulu-Natal said on Saturday it was ready to proceed with the trial on Monday.KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said the State was of the view that the matter was set down for Monday.

Yengeni and Shaik were both jailed for fraud.Sunday Tribune
