When the bus stopped, there were people swearing at me and my mother. I asked myself what more could I have done to get the respect of this team (Sundowns) but I understand that it’s football. I know the person who is behind it that is bitter because I left. I had to move on with my life,” said Mosimane.🤔![CDATA[]]>🤔![CDATA[]]>🤔![CDATA[]]>🤔 pic.twitter.com/MDOg5OuXja— moira (@moiramtsports) May 22, 2021 Sundowns have since condemned the behaviour from a section of their fans.ALSO READ: Al Ahly's Pitso Mosimane saddened by hostile South African homecoming“Mamelodi Sundowns observed behavior and conduct from some of its supporters before its match with Al Ahly which is unacceptable and improper and does not reflect the integrity, respect, compassion and other values which we uphold,” read a Sundowns club statement.What an incredible send off 🙏![CDATA[]]>🏾![CDATA[]]>🦅 thank you for the constant support! https://t.co/Rmo8Er3b7J— Pitso Mosimane (@TheRealPitso) May 23, 2021 “We received complaints by supporters of improper conduct and insults but Mamelodi Sundowns supporters should under no circumstances disrespect, insult or behave in the manner they did and must at all times stay true to our values and principles.ALSO READ: I’m very confident we’ll beat Al Ahly, says Sundowns coach Manqoba MngqithiWe therefore want to apologize to Al Ahly and those associated with the club,” read a club statement issued by Masandawana,” it added.The statement concluded by saying that Sundowns will be conducting an investigation in order to find out the identities of the individuals who abused Mosimane before taking appropriate action.
