More than 30 million doses of Pfizer vaccine have been ordered.The regulator said the updated advice was expected to make storage easier and possible for a wider range of health facilities.Related Video:!function(e,t,r){let n;if(e.getElementById(r))return;const a=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];n=e.createElement("script"),n.id=r,n.defer=!0,n.src="https://playback.oovvuu.media/player/v1.js",a.parentNode.insertBefore(n,a)}(document,0,"oovvuu-player-sdk");rudolph.nkgadima@africannewsagency.com
