We are united. We have had enough of oppression."Simon Makepace, a 61-year-old accountant told AFP he had joined the protests because "the whole world should be doing something about it, including this country".Protesters display placards and banners as they take part in demonstration against Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in central London on July 19, 2014 against Gaza strikes.

Riot police used water cannon and there were minor scuffles with protesters in front of the embassy, AFP correspondents reported.In Rome, a few hundred people gathered near the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, carrying large Palestinian flags and chanting slogans."No need to be Muslim to support the Palestinians," read one placard: "You just need to be a human being."In Tunisia, demonstrations took place in several cities.

More than 560 Israelis have been wounded.AFP
