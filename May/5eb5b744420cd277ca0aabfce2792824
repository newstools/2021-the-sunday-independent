Johannesburg - There is still no sign of reopening the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital three weeks after a fire gutted several sections of the Johannesburg facility.Meanwhile, patients have experienced difficulty with getting their medication following the closure of the hospital after a fire engulfed it last month.Annatjie van Loggerenberg, a Johannesburg resident, said her husband could not get his medication as he usually receives his medication from the hospital.“We don’t know what to do. My husband was supposed to get his medication this morning at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital. When he got there, they said it was closed. We thought and hoped that the hospital would be open but we are confused as to what is going on. Where should patients go? Medication is needed,” she said.Benick Mbuso, who lives in Yeoville, is a renal patient at the hospital who’s also had difficulty getting his medication from the hospital.“I am a renal patient at the hospital. Thursday was my appointment date. I would like to know where I can possibly go. I have run out of medication and I need to get it soon,” said Mbuso.The Gauteng Department of Health has meanwhile advised the public to seek help at other hospitals across the province. “Patients are advised to be in touch with the Gauteng Citizens Relationship Management (Hotline) on 0800 22 8827, 0800 428 8364 or email hotline@gauteng.gov.za or support@gauteng.gov.za on how they can get access to services that are normally rendered at the hospital,” said Gauteng Department of Health spokesperson Philani Mhlungu.lesego.makgatho@inl.co.zaSunday Independent
