Lukhanyo Am will continue as captain and Siya will be allowed to concentrate solely on playing rugby.‚ÄùThe 29-year-old Kolisi said the move to Durban from Cape Town presented a massive change in his life but one he can‚Äôt wait to embrace.‚ÄúI regard this as starting my career all over again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have a deep hunger to earn the respect of my new teammates. I am happy to prove myself all over again in what I see as a great move for my career. I am my biggest critic and I know what I have to do to get back to my best, and that means rolling up my sleeves and fighting for a place in the Sharks team. I can‚Äô wait to get my head down and get on with the business of playing rugby.‚ÄùKolisis said he is fully free of the hamstring and knee injures that have dogged him over the last year or so and will be in the starting blocks when the Sharks resume training on Monday for the new season@MikeGreenaway67IOL Sport
