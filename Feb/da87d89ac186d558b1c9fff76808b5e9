By Alexander WinningJohannesburg - South Africa's first coronavirus vaccine doses arrived by aeroplane on Monday, offering some relief for health workers who have been stretched during a second wave of infections and are first in line for the shots.President Cyril Ramaphosa and other top officials were at the OR Tambo international airport to receive the 1 million shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII).Some scientists and health workers have publicly criticised the government for not securing access to vaccines sooner.In remarks carried on state broadcaster SABC, Ramaphosa said he was delighted the first shots had arrived and that he would say more during an address to the nation scheduled for 8 pm tonight.South Africa has recorded the most Covid-19 infections and deaths on the African continent, at more than 1.4 million cases and over 44 000 deaths to date.Since late last year, it has battled a more contagious virus variant called 501Y.V2 that has also been detected in countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia.Emirates Airlines flight EK761 arrives at the OR Tambo International Airport from Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai. The plane is carrying 1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine from the Serum Institute of India.

Shots developed by Pfizer and BioNTech could start arriving around March, but the timing of 9 million promised Johnson & Johnson doses is not yet clear.The National Treasury estimates it could cost up to R24 billion to vaccinate 40 million South Africans.
