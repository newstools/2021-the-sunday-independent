MELBOURNE - World number one Novak Djokovic said on Sunday he had little respect for Nick Kyrgios's off-court antics after the polarising Australian recently called him "a tool".Kyrgios has waged a running battle with the Serb in recent times, sparked by Djokovic's ill-fated Adria Tour exhibition series last year as the coronavirus pandemic raged.After lashing his "stupidity" when several players who took part contracted Covid-19, Kyrgios also quickly weighed in when Djokovic was sensationally disqualified from the US Open for hitting a woman line judge in the throat with a ball.And last month, he dismissed him as a "tool" after the Serb issued a list of demands for quarantined players who arrived on charter flights for the Australian Open.ALSO READ: Novak Djokovic is our LeBron James but we have to call him out sometimes - Nick KyrgiosDjokovic, who is gunning for an 18th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, said he had mixed views on the combustible Kyrgios."I think he's good for the sport.

I have respect for everyone else really because everyone has a right and freedom to choose how they want to express themselves, what they want to do."My respect goes to him for the tennis he's playing.ALSO READ: Racquet-smashing, swearing Kyrgios suffers injury-hit defeat"Off the court, I don't have much respect for him, to be honest."That's where I'll close it.
