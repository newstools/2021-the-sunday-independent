Nxumalo confirmed that only legal representatives could visit Zuma, under strict protocols due to Covid-19, and no other members of the family was allowed.Manyi said they were concerned about Zuma’s safety.“Some people managed to take photos of him inside the prison without his consent and knowledge, imagine if that camera person was carrying a gun.“We are very concerned about his safety, he is in a vulnerable environment and anything can happen, they can kill him if they want to, or poison him if they wish to.”Manyi said the foundation strongly condemned the violence that erupted in KwaZulu-Natal after Zuma was incarcerated at the Estcourt Correctional Centre on Wednesday night.“We condemn the violence but we can’t control people’s anger. “Zuma was detained without trial which is also violence against him. “Steve Biko was killed while in detention. “Zuma’s sentencing itself is also violence against his basic human rights.”Manyi confirmed that Zuma launched two legal challenges in a bid to stay out of prison.He confirmed that Zuma’s rescission application was expected to be argued tomorrow.Zuma’s lawyer, advocate Dali Mpofu, argued in the Pietermaritzburg High Court that the warrant of arrest against his client should not be executed until the outcome of the rescission application.Sunday Independent
