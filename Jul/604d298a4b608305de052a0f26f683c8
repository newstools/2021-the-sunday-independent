As part of developing the Gauteng Rapid Rail Integrated Network (GRRIN) extensions, the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) completed a feasibility study which is currently awaiting the National Treasury approval. This feasibility study identified various links with a total of 149km of rail and 19 stations for the final route. These extensions will span over various areas and will be developed in multi phases over an extended period. When fully implemented, the proposed GRRIN extensions will include the following:A link between Marlboro and Soweto with an additional station at Sandton, as well as new stations at Randburg, Cosmo City, Little Falls, Roodepoort, and Jabulani;A link between Jabulani and Mamelodi through Cosmo City, with new stations at Fourways, Sunninghill, Olievenhoutsbosch, Irene, Tshwane East, Hazeldean, and Mamelodi;A link between Rhodesfield and Boksburg with new stations at East Rand Mall, and Boksburg; andA link between Cosmo City and Lanseria Airport with new stations at Cradle and Lanseria.Below is a graphic representation of the current Gautrain System as well as the proposed GRRIN extensions.As part of the project preparatory work, the proposed routes of the GRRN extensions are subjected to a public participation process that provides an opportunity for, members of the public, as well as interested and affected parties to comment in writing to the MEC for Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure on the recommended routes.
