Kubayi said: “The trends are clearly showing that other provinces which are currently lagging are going to experience the same trend we are seeing in Gauteng. Most notably in the Western Cape and North West when we look at the latest numbers. What's worrying as well is the positivity rate in Limpopo which is almost 42%.”“We are also paying attention to what’s happening in the Eastern Cape as well as in KwaZulu-Natal.
