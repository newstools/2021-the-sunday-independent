WHILE reports have suggested that some hospitals in Gauteng were  running out of beds, the province has denied those reports.According to Gauteng government spokesperson Thabo Masebe, the challenge facing the province is not a shortage of hospital beds but a proper system to manage the hospital capacity.“At the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital there are more than 400 beds that are lying there not being utilised. We have added new beds at the Bronkhorstspruit Hospital and Anglo Gold Ashanti as well as the Jubilee Hospital, so there are enough beds. What we need is a proper system to manage that capacity,” Masebe said.The provincial health department said the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Jubilee District Hospital, the Bronkhorstspruit Hospital and the re-purposed Tshwane District Hospital will be able to handle the load, thanks to newly-built infrastructure.On Sunday, the number of Covid-19 patients in Gauteng health facilities stood at 5 218, with 1 105 admitted to the intensive care units and a further 538 on life support machines.
