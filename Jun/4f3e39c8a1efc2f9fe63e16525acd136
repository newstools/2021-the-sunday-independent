karabo.ngoepe@inl.co.zaAcademics have joined forces to defend University of SA (UNISA) Vice-Chancellor Professor Puleng LenkaBula against what they have termed character assassination and intentional sabotage of her leadership.At least 25 professors and doctors from different South African universities have written a letter calling on the Minister of Higher Education and Training Dr Blade Nzimande, to intervene in the hostile and bullying environment to undermine LenkaBula's efforts at repositioning Unisa as one of the leading universities in the continent."We have noticed with great concern and disgust at the way the new Principal and Vice-Chancellor(P&VC) of the University of South Africa, Professor Puleng LenkaBula's leadership is being questioned and undermined in public," the academics wrote."We, as the undersigned group of scholars, particularly women in the South African academy, demand that Professor Puleng LenkaBula be given time and space to focus on the articulation of her vision of Unisa in advancing the academic project," they added.LenkaBula has found herself in the news in recent weeks following the suspension of the institution's executive director for legal services, Advocate Modidima Mannya.Mannya was suspended on April 8, 2021, for allegedly being insolent, misogynistic and bullying staff. He dragged Unisa to court to challenge his suspension, which he claimed was unlawful. He later withdrew his legal challenge.The academics believe Mannya's actions were motivated by ulterior motives, particularly LankaBula's gender. They said what was happening was an example of the challenges females in the academy face."These concerning attacks on her capacity as Unisa's Principal and Vice-Chancellor (P&VC) is symptomatic of a systemic attack on women's leadership and their ability to drive social change that is sorely needed. The questioning of her qualifications and recruitment process pertaining to her occupying the office of the P & VC, are demobilising her from dealing with the inherited institutional challenges," they wrote."It is not coincidental that the first black woman principal and vice-chancellor of one of the largest universities on the African continent is mired in unnecessary controversy that detracts from the real transformation agenda of the University. We see this as part of the bigger gender transformation paradox within the African academy."This week, sources within the University told the publication that Mannya's suspension was due to 'his lying, bullying and disrespecting colleagues, especially women .'As one source put it, "to show his disdain and disregard of women leadership, he had already taken the VC to the CCMA for reprimanding him within the first three months in office. He even wrote a letter to his boss, Professor Khehla Ndlovu, that he doesn't want to work with women," said another source speaking on condition of anonymity.Unisa spokesperson Tommy Huma declined to comment on the matter, saying it was subjudice."We can not comment on the matter as it is still before the court," he said.Another source said LenkaBula was being demonised for turning things around, prioritising tuition, research and community service. She found many challenges, including a failure rate of more than fifty percent and unresponsive administrative processes. She has given the academics the inspiration and support to improve the University's standing."When she arrived here, the University was in shambles. Some staff did not have the tools of the trade. The unions were the most vocal, while the inputs of academics never mattered. There was a bullying culture, and women were marginalised. All the attacks she has endured are sponsored. She is being persecuted for institutional problems that have been in existence for the past five or six years," said the sourceAttempts to get comment from Mannya were unsuccessful.The academics said women are being recruited into offices and are celebrated publicly for breaking barriers, whereas there are no systematic structures designed to support them institutionally."As one of the leading universities in Africa, Unisa has the opportunity to chart new paths towards meaningful social change. How Unisa handles this critical moment in its history/herstory has direct implications on how we can move from mere symbolic representation to enabling women's leadership in all spheres of society," they wrote.The academics called on Nzimande to intervene by keeping accountable the University to its transformation and constitutional mandate."As the undersigned women and allies in the academy, we reject the bullying and misogyny that seeks to undermine the authority of the VC's office. We will not be pushed out; we have decided to stop running, and we are here to stay, build, create and lead," the academics concluded.Nzimande's spokesperson, Ishmael Mnisi confirmed that the letter was received."I acknowledge having received the letter and that the Minister will reflect on its content and engage the authors and the Vice Chancellor through the Unisa Council," Mnisi said.
