Durban - The man who first discovered the shiny stones that resemble diamonds in KwaHlathi, outside Ladysmith has gone into hiding.Dwayne Maskutule, 41, a herdsman, kept what he found a secret until last month when he unwittingly told his friends about what he discovered while watching the cattle grazing last year.Two weeks ago, during a wedding ceremony held in the village where the locals gathered, talk about what Maskutule found began to spread.Now, everyone in the rural town, where nothing much happens, wants Maskutule to show them where the “diamonds” are, so they too can become rich.Maskutule has since been relieved of his herdsman duties by his employer, as they both believed he was in danger.MORE ON THISKZN diamond rush: Anxious wait for KwaHlathi community as experts collect samples for analysisDon't ridicule the diamond diggers of KwaHlathi; give them jobsPICS & VIDEO: Miners hope to strike it rich in KZN diamond rush town“Many people have been coming here looking for him. I had to tell him to stop work because it interrupted his duties. I have to protect him,” said his employer.Maskutule confided in his employer last year when he brought the stones home.“I am surprised by what is going on now because when he first brought the stones we never thought it could turn into what it is now.“I knew about the stones over a year ago and I discouraged him from bringing them here because I could see it was not diamonds,” Maskutule employer said.“But another herdsman told people during the wedding that Maskutule found diamonds and that he was going to be a millionaire.“Now people are coming to my house looking for him.“They harass him while he is doing his job, forcing him to go to the mining site to show them where he found the diamonds.”Department of Mineral Resources and Energy said a detailed analysis would be conducted on the samples made available to the team and conclusive results were expected within a period not exceeding 30 days.

The way they have been mining has a negative environmental effect.“The ground they are digging up is grazing land, but they have dug up big holes and left them open.“Our livestock are going to fall into the holes and die. Besides that, there are lots of people from outside the village who are coming here and mining even at night. This could lead to crime increasing.”This week, various authorities descended on the village, trying to dissuade the locals from mining activities.Maskutule’s employer said the chief and the police had urged the community to stop but to no avail.Thousands of punters gathered in KwaHlathi village in Ladysmith in search for what was suspected to be diamonds.

I was very excited after a buyer paid me for my diamonds. I have been coming here every day searching for the stones,” she said.Lethukuthula Sibisi, 37, said he made R2 000 over the week selling pieces of the stones.Sibisi said he sold them according to sizes, between R200 and R400 to people who had come driving cars.“It may not be a diamond but people loved these stones. I have managed to make some money and I have been here every day for the past two weeks.“Today I came here at 6am and I am not sure when I am going to leave, I have collected a lot with different sizes,” he said.But the stones were not the only things being sold there, fast food and alcohol stalls were also booming and people went around merrily supporting each other.A team of experts from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy – including officials from the South African Diamonds and Precious Metals Regulator, the Council for Geoscience, and Mintek also inspected the site.According to the department, a detailed analysis would be conducted on the samples made available to the team and conclusive results were expected within a period not exceeding 30 days.siboniso.mngadi@inl.co.zaSunday Tribune
